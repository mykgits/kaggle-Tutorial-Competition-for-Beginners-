Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on various features from the dataset. The goal is to use the given training data to train a model and make predictions on the test data.

Project Overview
The Titanic survival prediction project is a classic example of a binary classification problem where the task is to predict whether a passenger survived (Survived = 1) or not (Survived = 0). The dataset includes features such as the passenger’s age, gender, ticket class, number of family members aboard, and more.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Dropping unnecessary columns.
Feature encoding.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features like FamilySize.
Modeling:

Using a Random Forest classifier for prediction.
Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using AUC (Area Under the Curve) to measure the performance on the validation set.
Submission:

Predictions are generated for the test data and saved in a CSV file.
Requirements
To run this project locally, you need the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Files in the Repository
train.csv: The dataset used for training the model.
test.csv: The dataset used for generating predictions.
sample_submission.csv: A sample format for submission.
submission.csv: The generated submission file containing predictions.
titanic_prediction.py: The script containing the complete code for preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.
How to Run the Code
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
Place the provided train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv in the repository folder.

Run the Python script to train the model and generate predictions:

bash
Copy code
python titanic_prediction.py
The predictions will be saved in a file called submission.csv.

Model Used
I used a Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively. The model was trained on the training data, and its performance was validated using the AUC score.

Evaluation Metric
The model’s performance was measured using AUC (Area Under the Curve). AUC helps evaluate how well the model is predicting the survival probabilities, making it suitable for this binary classification task.
